# NotAGame
this is not a game i swear
Test to get keyboard input with a non-blocking way.

## Usage
Clone this repository and, if you have Docker installed, run the following commands:
- Build the image with `docker build -t notagame .`
- Run the container with `docker run --rm --name notagame -it notagame`

If you don't have Docker installed or don't want to build the image for such a little piece of shit, you can run it directally with `python gm.py` or `python3 gm.py` (assuming that you have python installed).
